# About Us

new Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC), based at the University of Chicago. The big data resource combines two independent efforts at UChicago and the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) into a common infrastructure that will support richer scientific data and more powerful analytic tools.

The data resource will be funded by the National Institutes of Health and the contract award totals $43,196,984 over five years, if all options are exercised. The primary awardee is the University of Chicago, with sub-awards given to JCVI, the University of Virginia and the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes.

The new BV-BRC will combine the data, technology, and extensive user communities from two long-running centers: PATRIC, the bacterial system, and IRD/ViPR, the viral systems. Currently, PATRIC hosts 200,000 bacterial genomes and IRD/ViPR hosts 1.5 million viral genomes. In addition, the two resources host data on protein structure and function, clinical studies, drug targets and resistance, epidemiology, and other features, and provide open source tools for data analysis and genomic annotation.


This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. 75N93019C00076.



Rick Stevens, Professor of Computer Science at UChicago, Associate Laboratory Director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences at Argonne National Laboratory, and co-principal investigator of BV-BRC. “This new center will transform existing resources into a scalable platform for comparative bioinformatics, large-scale data analysis, integrative data mining and discovery, and artificial intelligence in support of the infectious disease research community.”


The merging of the PATRIC and IRD/ViPR resources is an exciting opportunity that will allow us to combine the complementary expertise in genomics and high-performance computing of these two teams and take advantage of the latest developments in big data analytics and artificial intelligence,” said Richard Scheuermann, La Jolla Campus Director of the J. Craig Venter Institute, Adjunct Professor of Pathology at the University of California San Diego, and co-principal investigator of BV-BRC.
